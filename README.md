# PointInterview

## SETUP

1. [Set Up Your Environment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup) (Make sure you have typescript installed globally!)
2. [Clone The Project](https://github.com/connorpmullins/PointInterview)
3. run `yarn` from the directory in the terminal
4. (ios) `cd ios && pod install `
5. `react-native run-ios` (or run-android)

## NOTES

- If I code anymore I'm going a fair bit beyond the allotted interview time.
- In the interview I talked about some of the next steps, which would be: implementing designer notes in Zeplin to the T, phone number formatting, implementing a photo picker, and having a page without the `- - -` header indicator
